v0.96 [2013-07-06]
Fixed bug where a level being saved near the end of a ROM bank sometimes caused a bad pointer
    (i.e. sometimes a chunk of data would need to be moved to the beginning of the next bank
    when the current bank ran out of space, but the pointer to the data didn't reflect this
    because the pointer was written BEFORE moving to the next bank. oops...)
    [thanks DarkMatt for initially finding this]
