Interface/misc:
 - use tr() more when appropriate (for future translation support)
 - kirby-related toolbar/menu/mainwindow icons
 - move terrain/obstacle enums into kirby.h or something
 - emulator preview button/asm hack
 - use QHash/QMap for metatile data
 - much smaller build of Qt5 binaries on windows

2D view:
 - less bad programmer art
 - info display should depend less on specific font metrics (i have no idea what it looks like
   on OS X / Linux)
 
3D view:
 - rest of possible bumpers for 2way slopes (sometimes with gaps in corners if necessary)
 - come up with a way to fix the QPixmap -> QImage -> QPixmap bottleneck when flipping 8x8 tiles
