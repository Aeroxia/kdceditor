Interface/misc:
 - use tr() more when appropriate (for future translation support)
 - kirby-related toolbar/menu/mainwindow icons
 - move terrain/obstacle enums into kirby.h or something
 - emulator preview button/asm hack
 - use QHash/QMap for metatile data
 - much smaller build of Qt5 binaries on windows

2D view:
 - less bad programmer art

3D view:
 - rest of possible bumpers for 2way slopes (sometimes with gaps in corners if necessary)
 - come up with a way to fix the QPixmap -> QImage -> QPixmap bottleneck when flipping 8x8 tiles
   (this will speed up drawing immensely, but it's already not that slow on most modern machines)
